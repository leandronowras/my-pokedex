# How To View Pokémon Details

Open any Pokémon card from the grid to explore official artwork, stats, evolutions, and sprites. Follow these steps to navigate the detail view with confidence.

## Prerequisites
- You can browse the Pokédex home page.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. From the main Pokédex grid, click a Pokémon card to open its detail page.
2. Review the header to confirm the Pokédex number, name, generation badge, and type badges.
3. Scroll down to the **Base Stats** card to view each stat bar and the total score.
4. In the **Evolution Chain** section, click another evolution card to jump to that species.
5. Continue to the **Sprites** card to compare front and back sprites when available.
6. Click **Back to Pokédex** in the top-left corner when you are ready to return to the main list.

## Expected Results
- The detail page shows official artwork, stats, and generation information for the selected Pokémon.
- The **Evolution Chain** highlights the current Pokémon with a **Current** badge.
- Selecting another evolution reloads the page with the new Pokémon’s details.

## Troubleshooting
- **Problem:** “I see a blank page after clicking a card.”
  - **Cause:** The PokéAPI request may have failed or the Pokémon ID is invalid.
  - **Solution:** Click **Back to Pokédex** and try another Pokémon. If the issue persists, refresh the page.
- **Problem:** “Evolution cards open in the same page and I lose my place.”
  - **Cause:** Evolution links load within the detail view by design.
  - **Solution:** Use your browser’s back button to return to the previous Pokémon, or open the evolution link in a new tab.
