# How To Filter Pokémon

Use the filters on the home page to narrow the Pokémon list to the exact creatures you want to see. Follow these steps to combine search, type, and generation filters.

## Prerequisites
- You can browse the Pokédex home page.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Open the Pokédex and scroll to the **Find your Pokémon** card at the top of the list.
2. In the search field labeled “Search Pokémon (includes evolutions)...”, type the name or evolution you want to find.
3. Click the **Filter by Type** dropdown and choose a type such as **Water** or **Fire** to limit results.
4. Click the **Filter by Generation** dropdown and select a region, for example **Kanto**, to focus on that era.
5. Open the **Items per page** dropdown and pick how many cards you want to see at once.
6. Review the summary text under the filters to confirm how many Pokémon match your selection.
7. Click **Clear Filters** if you want to reset the list and start again.

## Expected Results
- The grid updates immediately to show only Pokémon that match the selected filters.
- The summary text updates to show how many Pokémon are being displayed.
- Clearing the filters returns the grid to the full Pokédex listing.

## Troubleshooting
- **Problem:** “My search finds no Pokémon.”
  - **Cause:** The spelling may not match the PokéAPI entry, or another filter is hiding the result.
  - **Solution:** Clear all filters, then type at least three letters of the Pokémon name and reapply other filters one at a time.
- **Problem:** “The **Clear Filters** button is missing.”
  - **Cause:** The button only appears when at least one filter is active.
  - **Solution:** Adjust any filter (for example, choose a type) so the button appears, then click **Clear Filters**.
