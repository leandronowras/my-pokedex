# How To Browse Pokémon

Browse the Pokédex home page to see the full list of Pokémon in order. This guide explains where to go and how to move between pages quickly.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the Pokédex web app.
- A desktop or mobile browser with an internet connection.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Open the Pokédex at https://my-pokedex-production.up.railway.app/.
2. Scroll down to the **Find your Pokémon** card and review the summary line under the filters to see how many entries are visible.
3. Scroll past the filters to reach the Pokémon grid and view the cards in number order.
4. At the bottom of the list, click **Next** to load the following page or **Previous** to revisit the prior page.
5. Select any page button in the pagination bar to jump directly to that portion of the Pokédex.
6. Click the name or artwork on a Pokémon card to open its detail page in a new view.

## Expected Results
- The Pokémon grid shows cards sorted by Pokédex ID with names, types, and artwork.
- The pagination bar updates to highlight the current page.
- Selecting a Pokémon opens a dedicated detail view for that species.

## Troubleshooting
- **Problem:** “I cannot see the pagination bar.”
  - **Cause:** You may be on the final cached page for your session.
  - **Solution:** Scroll back to the top, adjust the filters, or refresh the page to load more Pokémon.
- **Problem:** “Nothing happens when I click a Pokémon card.”
  - **Cause:** Browser pop-up blockers or tracking protection might prevent navigation.
  - **Solution:** Allow navigation for the site or open the link in a new tab using Shift+Click.
